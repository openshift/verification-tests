  Scenario: Endpoints should update in time and no delay
    Given I have a project
    Given I obtain test data file "networking/list_for_pods.json"
    When I run the :create client command with:
      | f | list_for_pods.json |
    Then the step should succeed
    When a pod becomes ready with labels:
      | name=test-pods|
    Then I wait for the "test-service" endpoint to appear up to 5 seconds

  Scenario: Existing pods will not be affected when node is unschedulable
    Given I have a project
    When I run the :create client command with:
      | f | https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift/origin/master/examples/hello-openshift/hello-pod.json |
    Then the step should succeed
    And the pod named "hello-openshift" status becomes :running
    And evaluation of `pod.node_name` is stored in the :pod_node clipboard
    And evaluation of `pod.ip` is stored in the :pod_ip clipboard
    Given I obtain test data file "pods/pod-pull-by-tag.yaml"
    When I run the :create client command with:
      | f | pod-pull-by-tag.yaml |
    Then the step should succeed
    And the pod named "pod-pull-by-tag" status becomes :running
    Given node schedulable status should be restored after scenario
    When I run the :oadm_cordon_node admin command with:
      | node_name | <%= cb.pod_node %> |
    Then the step should succeed
    When I execute on the pod:
      | bash |
      | -c   |
      | curl http://<%= cb.pod_ip %>:8080 |
    Then the step should succeed
    And the output should contain:
      | Hello OpenShift |
