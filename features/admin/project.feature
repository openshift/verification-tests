  Scenario: Pod creation should fail when pod's node selector conflicts with project node selector
    Given a 5 characters random string of type :dns is stored into the :proj_name clipboard
    When I run the :oadm_new_project admin command with:
      | project_name  | <%= cb.proj_name %> |
      | node_selector | region=west         |
      | admin         | <%= user.name %>    |
    Then the step should succeed
    Given I obtain test data file "pods/selector-east.json"
    When I run the :create admin command with:
      | f | selector-east.json |
      | n | <%= cb.proj_name %> |
    Then the step should fail
    And the output should match:
      | pod node label selector conflicts with its project node label selector |

  Scenario: The job and HPA should be deleted when project has been deleted
    Given I have a project
    Given I obtain test data file "hpa/hpa.yaml"
    When I run the :create client command with:
      | f | hpa.yaml |
    Then the step should succeed
    Given I obtain test data file "job/job.yaml"
    When I run the :create client command with:
      | f | job.yaml |
    Then the step should succeed
    Given evaluation of `project.name` is stored in the :saved_name clipboard
    When I delete the project
    Then the step should succeed
    Given I switch to cluster admin pseudo user
    # Sometimes the project is Terminating when checked by cluster-admin, so need wait.
    And I wait for the resource "project" named "<%= cb.saved_name %>" to disappear
    When I run the :get client command with:
      | resource      | hpa                  |
      | resource_name | php-apache           |
      | n             | <%= cb.saved_name %> |
    Then the step should fail
    Then the output should contain:
      | not found |
    When I run the :get client command with:
      | resource      | job                 |
      | resource_name | pi                  |
      | n             | <%= cb.saved_name %> |
    Then the step should fail
    Then the output should contain:
      | not found |
