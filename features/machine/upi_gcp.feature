  Scenario: [GCP] Scaling OCP Cluster on UPI
    Given I have an UPI deployment and machinesets are enabled
    And I switch to cluster admin pseudo user
    And I use the "openshift-machine-api" project
    And admin ensures machine number is restored after scenario

    Given I clone a machineset and name it "machineset-clone-25034"

    # Create clusterautoscaler
    Given I obtain test data file "cloud/cluster-autoscaler.yml"
    When I run the :create admin command with:
      | f | cluster-autoscaler.yml |
    Then the step should succeed
    And admin ensures "default" clusterautoscaler is deleted after scenario
    And 1 pod becomes ready with labels:
      | cluster-autoscaler=default,k8s-app=cluster-autoscaler |

    # Create machineautoscaler
    Given I obtain test data file "cloud/machine-autoscaler.yml"
    When I run oc create over "machine-autoscaler.yml" replacing paths:
      | ["metadata"]["name"]               | maotest                 |
      | ["spec"]["minReplicas"]            | 1                       |
      | ["spec"]["maxReplicas"]            | 3                       |
      | ["spec"]["scaleTargetRef"]["name"] | <%= machine_set.name %> |
    Then the step should succeed
    And admin ensures "maotest" machineautoscaler is deleted after scenario

    # Create workload
    Given I obtain test data file "cloud/autoscaler-auto-tmpl.yml"
    When I run the :create admin command with:
      | f | autoscaler-auto-tmpl.yml |
    Then the step should succeed
    And admin ensures "workload" job is deleted from the "openshift-machine-api" project after scenario

    # Verify machineset has scaled
    Given I wait up to 300 seconds for the steps to pass:
    """
    Then the expression should be true> machine_set.desired_replicas(cached: false) == 3
    """
    Then the machineset should have expected number of running machines

    # Delete workload
    Given admin ensures "workload" job is deleted from the "openshift-machine-api" project
    # Check cluster auto scales down
    And I wait up to 300 seconds for the steps to pass:
    """
    Then the expression should be true> machine_set.desired_replicas(cached: false) == 1
    """
    Then the machineset should have expected number of running machines
