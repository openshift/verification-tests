  Scenario Outline: Maven repository can be used to providing dependency caching for xPaas templates
    Given I have a project
    When I run the :new_app client command with:
      | template | <template>                                       |
      | param    | <env_name>=https://repo1.maven.org/non-existing/ |
      | param    | <parameter_name>=myapp                           |
    Then the step should succeed
    Given the "myapp-1" build was created
    And the "myapp-1" build failed
    When I run the :logs client command with:
      | resource_name | build/myapp-1 |
    Then the output should contain:
      | https://repo1.maven.org/non-existing/ |

  Scenario: Create Laravel application with a MySQL database using default template laravel-mysql-example
    Given I have a project
    Then I run the :new_app client command with:
      | template | laravel-mysql-persistent |
    Then the step should succeed
    Then the "laravel-mysql-persistent-1" build was created
    And the "laravel-mysql-persistent-1" build completed
    And a pod becomes ready with labels:
      | deployment=laravel-mysql-persistent-1 |
    And I wait for the "laravel-mysql-persistent" service to become ready
    Then I wait for a web server to become available via the "laravel-mysql-persistent" route

  Scenario: PyPi index can be used to providing dependencies for django-psql-example template
    Given I have a project
    When I run the :new_app client command with:
      | template | django-psql-persistent                                               |

    Then the step should succeed
    Given the "myapp-1" build was created
    And the "myapp-1" build completed
    When I run the :build_logs client command with:
      | build_name | myapp-1 |
    Then the output should match:
      | Downloading\s*https://mirror.openshift.com/mirror/python/web/.* |
    When I run the :patch client command with:
      | resource      | bc                                                                                                                                                        |

    Then the step should succeed
    When I run the :start_build client command with:
      | buildconfig | myapp |
    Then the "myapp-2" build was created
    And the "myapp-2" build failed
    When I run the :build_logs client command with:
      | build_name | myapp-2 |
    Then the output should match:
      | Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement |
