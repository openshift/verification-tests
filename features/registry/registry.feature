  Scenario: Prune images by command oadm_prune_images
    Given cluster role "system:image-pruner" is added to the "first" user
    Given I enable image-registry default route
    Given default image registry route is stored in the :registry_ip clipboard
    And I have a project
    When I run the :policy_add_role_to_user client command with:
      | role            | registry-admin   |
      | user name       | system:anonymous |
    Then the step should succeed

    When I run the :import_image client command with:
      | from       | quay.io/openshifttest/busybox |
      | confirm    | true                          |
      | image_name | mystream                      |
    Then the step should succeed
    And the "mystream:latest" image stream tag was created
    And evaluation of `image_stream_tag("mystream:latest").image_layers(user:user)` is stored in the :layers clipboard
    And evaluation of `image_stream_tag("mystream:latest").digest(user:user)` is stored in the :digest clipboard
    And I ensure "mystream" imagestream is deleted
    Given I delete the project
    And I run the :oadm_prune_images client command with:
      | keep_younger_than | 0                     |
      | confirm           | true                  |
      | registry_url      | <%= cb.registry_ip %> |
    Then the step should succeed
    When I run the :get client command with:
      | resource | images |
    Then the step should succeed
    And the output should not contain:
      | <%= cb.digest %> |

  Scenario: Copy image to another tag via 'oc image mirror'
    Given I have a project
    Given docker config for default image registry is stored to the :dockercfg_file clipboard
    Then I run the :image_mirror client command with:
      | source_image | <%= cb.integrated_reg_ip %>/openshift/ruby:latest              |
      | dest_image   | <%= cb.integrated_reg_ip %>/<%= project.name %>/myimage:latest |

    And the step should succeed
    And the output should match:
      | Mirroring completed in |
    Given the "myimage" image stream was created
    And the "myimage" image stream becomes ready

  Scenario: Mirror multiple locations to another registry via 'oc image mirror'
    Given I have a project
    Given docker config for default image registry is stored to the :dockercfg_file clipboard
    Then I run the :image_mirror client command with:
      | source_image | quay.io/openshifttest/busybox:latest=<%= cb.integrated_reg_ip %>/<%= project.name %>/myimage1:v1        |

    And the step should succeed
    And the output should match:

    Given the "myimage1" image stream was created
    And the "myimage2" image stream was created
    And the "myimage1" image stream becomes ready
