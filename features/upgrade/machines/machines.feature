Feature: Machine-api components upgrade tests
  @upgrade-prepare
  Scenario Outline: Cluster operator should be available after upgrade - prepare
    # According to our upgrade workflow, we need an upgrade-prepare and upgrade-check for each scenario.
    # But some of them do not need any prepare steps, which lead to errors "can not find scenarios" in the log.
    # So we just add a simple/useless step here to get rid of the errors in the log.
    Given the expression should be true> "True" == "True"

  Examples:
    | cluster_operator     |
    | "machine-api"        |
    | "cluster-autoscaler" |

  Scenario Outline: Cluster operator should be available after upgrade
    Given evaluation of `cluster_operator(<cluster_operator>).condition(type: 'Available')` is stored in the :co_available clipboard
    Then the expression should be true> cb.co_available["status"]=="True"

    Given evaluation of `cluster_operator(<cluster_operator>).condition(type: 'Degraded')` is stored in the :co_degraded clipboard
    Then the expression should be true> cb.co_degraded["status"]=="False"

    Given evaluation of `cluster_operator(<cluster_operator>).condition(type: 'Upgradeable')` is stored in the :co_upgradable clipboard

    Given evaluation of `cluster_operator(<cluster_operator>).condition(type: 'Progressing')` is stored in the :co_progressing clipboard

  Scenario: There should be no pending or firing alerts for machine-api operators
    Given I switch to cluster admin pseudo user

    When I perform the GET prometheus rest client with:
      | path  | /api/v1/query?                                                                                                                     |

  Scenario: Scale up and scale down a machineSet after upgrade
    Given I have an IPI deployment
    And I switch to cluster admin pseudo user
    And I use the "openshift-machine-api" project
    And admin ensures machine number is restored after scenario

    Given I clone a machineset and name it "machineset-clone-22612"

    Given I scale the machineset to +2
    Then the step should succeed
    And the machineset should have expected number of running machines

    Given I have an IPI deployment

    # Create a machineset
    Given I get project machineset named "<%= machine_set.name %>" as YAML
    And I save the output to file> <machineset_name>.yaml
    And I replace content in "<machineset_name>.yaml":
      | <%= machine_set.name %> | <machineset_name> |
      | /replicas.*/            | replicas: 0       |

    When I run the :create admin command with:
      | f | <machineset_name>.yaml |
    Then the step should succeed

    Given as admin I successfully merge patch resource "machineset/<machineset_name>" with:
      | {"spec":{"replicas":1,"template":{"spec":{"providerSpec":{"value":{<value>}}}}}} |

    # Verify machine could be created successful
    And I wait up to 300 seconds for the steps to pass:
    """
    Then the expression should be true> machine_set("<machineset_name>").desired_replicas(cached: false) == 1
    """
    Then the machineset should have expected number of running machines

    And "machine-api-termination-handler" daemonset becomes ready in the "openshift-machine-api" project
    And 1 pod becomes ready with labels:
