  Scenario: upgrade OLM - prepare
    # Check OLM version
    Given the "operator-lifecycle-manager" operator version matches the current cluster version
    # Check cluster operator OLM status
    Given the status of condition "Degraded" for "operator-lifecycle-manager" operator is: False
    Given the status of condition "Progressing" for "operator-lifecycle-manager" operator is: False
    Given the status of condition "Available" for "operator-lifecycle-manager" operator is: True
    Given the status of condition "Upgradeable" for "operator-lifecycle-manager" operator is: True
    # # Create a namespace and an operator in it
    # Given I switch to cluster admin pseudo user
    # When I run the :new_project client command with:
    #   | project_name | olm-upgrade |
    # Given etcd operator "etcd-test" is installed successfully in "olm-upgrade" project
    # # Create customer resource in it
    # Given etcdCluster "sample-cluster" is installed successfully in "olm-upgrade" project

  Scenario: upgrade OLM
    # Check OLM version after upgraded
    Given the "operator-lifecycle-manager" operator version matches the current cluster version
    # Check cluster operator OLM status
    Given the status of condition "Degraded" for "operator-lifecycle-manager" operator is: False
    Given the status of condition "Progressing" for "operator-lifecycle-manager" operator is: False
    Given the status of condition "Available" for "operator-lifecycle-manager" operator is: True
    Given the status of condition "Upgradeable" for "operator-lifecycle-manager" operator is: True
    # # Check if this operator works well by changing its customer resource
    # Given I switch to cluster admin pseudo user
    # And I use the "olm-upgrade" project
    # When I run the :patch client command with:
    #   | resource      | etcdcluster            |
    #   | resource_name | sample-cluster         |
    #   | p             | {"spec": {"size": 4 }} |
    #   | type          | merge                  |
    # Then the step should succeed
    # Given status becomes :succeeded of exactly 4 pods labeled:
    #   | etcd_cluster=sample-cluster |
    # Then the step should succeed
    # Given etcdCluster "sample-cluster" is removed successfully from "olm-upgrade" project
    # Given etcd operator "etcd-test" is removed successfully from "olm-upgrade" project
    # # This operator can be re-installed succefully
    # Given etcd operator "etcd-test" is installed successfully in "olm-upgrade" project
