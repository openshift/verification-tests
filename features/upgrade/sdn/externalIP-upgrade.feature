  Scenario: Check the externalIP works well after upgrade - prepare
    Given I switch to cluster admin pseudo user
    And I run the :new_project client command with:
      | project_name | externalip-upgrade |
    Then the step should succeed
    Given I store the schedulable nodes in the :nodes clipboard
    And the Internal IP of node "<%= cb.nodes[0].name %>" is stored in the :hostip clipboard

    # Create additional network through CNO
    Given as admin I successfully merge patch resource "networks.config.openshift.io/cluster" with:
      | {"spec":{"externalIP":{"policy":{"allowedCIDRs":["<%= cb.hostip %>/24"]}}}} |

    # Create a svc with externalIP
    When I use the "externalip-upgrade" project
    Given I obtain test data file "networking/externalip_service1.json"
    And I wait up to 500 seconds for the steps to pass:
    """
    When I run oc create over "externalip_service1.json" replacing paths:
      | ["spec"]["externalIPs"][0] | <%= cb.hostip %>    |
      | n                          | externalip-upgrade  |
    Then the step should succeed
    """

    # Create a pod
    Given I obtain test data file "networking/externalip_pod_upgrade.yaml"
    When I run the :create client command with:
      | f | externalip_pod_upgrade.yaml |
      | n | externalip-upgrade          |
    Then the step should succeed
    Given a pod becomes ready with labels:
      | name=externalip-pod    |
    And evaluation of `pod(1).name` is stored in the :pod1name clipboard

    # Curl externalIP:portnumber should pass
    When I execute on the "<%= cb.pod1name %>" pod:
      | /usr/bin/curl | --connect-timeout | 10 | <%= cb.hostip %>:27017 |
    Then the output should contain:
      | Hello OpenShift! |
