  Scenario: Confirm node-node and pod-pod packets are ESP enrypted on IPsec clusters post upgrade - prepare
    Given the env is using "OVNKubernetes" networkType
    And the IPsec is enabled on the cluster
    Given I store all worker nodes to the :workers clipboard
    Given I switch to cluster admin pseudo user
    And the default interface on nodes is stored in the :default_interface clipboard
    When I run the :new_project client command with:
      | project_name | ipsec-upgrade |
    Then the step should succeed
    And the appropriate pod security labels are applied to the "ipsec-upgrade" namespace
    When I use the "ipsec-upgrade" project
    Given I obtain test data file "networking/list_for_pods.json"
    #Creating two test pods for pod-pod encryption check. Pods needs to be deployment/rc backed so that they can be migrate successfuly to the upgraded cluster.Creating each separat as they need to be on diff
    #nodes
    When I run oc create over "list_for_pods.json" replacing paths:
      | ["items"][0]["spec"]["template"]["spec"]["nodeName"]           | <%= cb.workers[1].name %> |
      | ["items"][0]["spec"]["replicas"]                               | 1                         |
      | ["items"][0]["metadata"]["name"]                               | hello-pod1-rc             |
      | ["items"][0]["spec"]["template"]["metadata"]["labels"]["name"] | hello-pod1                |
      | ["items"][1]["metadata"]["name"]                               | test-service1             |
    Then the step should succeed
    And a pod becomes ready with labels:
      | name=hello-pod1 |
    And evaluation of `pod.ip_url` is stored in the :test_pod_worker1 clipboard

    Given I obtain test data file "networking/list_for_pods.json"
    When I run oc create over "list_for_pods.json" replacing paths:
      | ["items"][0]["spec"]["template"]["spec"]["nodeName"]                 | <%= cb.workers[0].name %>                                                                      |
      | ["items"][0]["spec"]["replicas"]                                     | 1                                                                                              |
      | ["items"][0]["metadata"]["name"]                                     | hello-pod0-rc                                                                                  |
      | ["items"][0]["spec"]["template"]["metadata"]["labels"]["name"]       | hello-pod0                                                                                     |
      | ["items"][1]["metadata"]["name"]                                     | test-service0                                                                                  |
      | ["items"][0]["spec"]["template"]["spec"]["containers"][0]["command"] | ["bash", "-c", "for f in {0..36000}; do curl <%= cb.test_pod_worker1 %>:8080 ; sleep 1; done"] |

    Then the step should succeed
    #Above command will curl "hello openshift" traffic every 1 second to worker1 test pod which is expected to cause ESP traffic generation across those nodes
    And a pod becomes ready with labels:
      | name=hello-pod0 |
    #Quick pre-upgrade check whether nodes are getting ESP packets or not. Just to confirm IPsec functionality
    #Host network pod for running tcpdump on any  worker node to leverage tcpdump utility
    Given I obtain test data file "networking/net_admin_cap_pod.yaml"
    When I run oc create as admin over "net_admin_cap_pod.yaml" replacing paths:
      | ["spec"]["nodeName"]                                       | <%= cb.workers[0].name %> |
      | ["metadata"]["namespace"]                                  | ipsec-upgrade             |
      | ["metadata"]["name"]                                       | hostnw-pod-worker0        |
      | ["metadata"]["labels"]["name"]                             | network-pod               |
      | ["spec"]["containers"][0]["securityContext"]["privileged"] | true                      |
    Then the step should succeed
    And a pod becomes ready with labels:
       | name=network-pod |
    And evaluation of `pod.name` is stored in the :hostnw_pod_worker0 clipboard
    #capturing tcpdump for 2 seconds
    Given I use the "ipsec-upgrade" project
    When admin executes on the "<%= cb.hostnw_pod_worker0 %>" pod:
       | sh | -c | timeout  --preserve-status 2 tcpdump -i <%= cb.default_interface %> esp |
    Then the step should succeed
    And the output should contain "ESP"
    And admin ensures "hostnw-pod-worker0" pod is deleted from the "ipsec-upgrade" project
