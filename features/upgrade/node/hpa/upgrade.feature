  Scenario: Upgrade - Make sure multiple resources work well after upgrade - prepare
    Given I switch to cluster admin pseudo user
    Given I ensure "node-upgrade" project is deleted
    When I run the :new_project client command with:
      | project_name | node-upgrade |
    And I use the "node-upgrade" project
    Given I obtain test data file "infrastructure/hpa/hpa-v2beta1-rc.yaml"
    When I run the :create client command with:
      | f | hpa-v2beta1-rc.yaml |
    Then the step should succeed
    Given 1 pod becomes ready with labels:
      | run=hello-openshift |
    Given I obtain test data file "infrastructure/hpa/resource-metrics-cpu.yaml"
    When I run the :create client command with:
      | f | resource-metrics-cpu.yaml |
    Then the step should succeed
    Given I wait up to 300 seconds for the steps to pass:
    """
    Then expression should be true> hpa('resource-cpu').min_replicas(cached: false) == 2
    And expression should be true> hpa.max_replicas == 10

    """
    Given I obtain test data file "daemon/daemonset.yaml"
    When I run the :create client command with:

    When I run the :create client command with:
      | f | configmap.yaml |
      | n | <%= project.name %>                                       |
    Then the step should succeed
    Given I obtain test data file "configmap/pod-configmap-volume1.yaml"
    When I run the :create client command with:
      | f | pod-configmap-volume1.yaml |
    Then the step should succeed
    And the pod named "dapi-test-pod-1" status becomes :succeeded

  Scenario: Upgrade - Make sure multiple resources work well after upgrade
    Given I switch to cluster admin pseudo user
    When I use the "node-upgrade" project
    And admin ensures "node-upgrade" namespace is deleted after scenario
    Given I obtain test data file "infrastructure/hpa/hello-pod.yaml"
    When I run the :create client command with:
      | f | hello-pod.yaml |
    Then the step should succeed
    Given the pod named "hello-pod" status becomes :running within 60 seconds
    When I run the :expose client command with:
      | resource      | rc              |
      | resource name | hello-openshift |
      | port          | 8080            |
    Given I wait for the "hello-openshift" service to become ready
    When I run the :exec background client command with:
      | pod              | hello-pod                                                       |
