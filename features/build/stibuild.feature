  Scenario Outline: Trigger s2i/docker/custom build using additional imagestream
    Given I have a project
    Given I obtain test data file "templates/<template>"
    And I run the :new_app client command with:
      | file | <template> |
    Then the step should succeed
    And the "sample-build-1" build was created
    When I run the :cancel_build client command with:
      | build_name | sample-build-1                  |
    Then the step should succeed
    When I run the :import_image client command with:
      | image_name | myimage                                       |
      | from       | registry.redhat.io/rhscl/ruby-27-rhel7:latest |
      | confirm    | true                                          |
    Then the step should succeed
    And the "sample-build-2" build was created
    When I run the :describe client command with:
      | resource | builds         |
      | name     | sample-build-2 |
    Then the step should succeed
    And the output should contain:
      |Build trigger cause:	Image change                           |
      |Image ID:		registry.redhat.io/rhscl/ruby-27-rhel7 |
      |Image Name/Kind:	myimage:latest                                 |
    When I run the :start_build client command with:
      | buildconfig | sample-build |
    Then the step should succeed
    And the "sample-build-3" build was created
    When I get project builds
    Then the step should succeed
    And the output should not contain "sample-build-4"

      | app_repo     | https://github.com/openshift-qe/ruby-ex   |
    Then the step should succeed
    And the "ruby-ex-1" build completes
    When I run the :patch client command with:
      | resource      | buildconfig                                                                                                                                      |
