    Given I have a project

    When I run the :new_app client command with:

  Scenario: Mirroring built image doesn't degrade scheme2 ,keep consistent SHA's
    Given I have a project
    Given I save a htpasswd registry auth to the :combine_dockercfg clipboard

    And master CA is added to the "skopeo" dc
