  Scenario: Docker build with both SourceURI and context dir
    Given I have a project
    Given I obtain test data file "build/ruby20rhel7-context-docker.json"
    When I run the :create client command with:
      | f | ruby20rhel7-context-docker.json |
    Then the step should succeed
    When I run the :new_app client command with:
      | template | ruby-helloworld-sample |
    Then the step should succeed
    And the "ruby20-sample-build-1" build was created
    And the "ruby20-sample-build-1" build completed
    When I run the :describe client command with:
      | resource | buildconfig         |
      | name     | ruby20-sample-build |
