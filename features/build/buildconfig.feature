  Scenario: OCP-12121:ImageRegistry Start build from buildConfig/build
    Given I have a project

      | image_stream | openshift/ruby:latest |
      | app_repo     | https://github.com/openshift/ruby-hello-world |
    Then the step should succeed
    And the "ruby-hello-world-1" build was created
    And the "ruby-hello-world-1" build finished
    When I run the :start_build client command with:
      | buildconfig | ruby-hello-world |
    Then the step should succeed
    And the "ruby-hello-world-2" build was created
    And the "ruby-hello-world-2" build completed
    When I run the :start_build client command with:
      | from_build | ruby-hello-world-2 |

  Scenario Outline: Build with images pulled from private repositories
    Given I have a project
    When I run the :create_secret client command with:
     | name        | pull                                                                            |

  Scenario: OCP-12057:BuildAPI Using secret to pull a docker image which be used as source input
    Given I have a project
    When I run the :create_secret client command with:
     | name        | pull                                                                            |
