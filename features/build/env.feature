  Scenario: Can set env vars on buildconfig with new-app --env and --env-file
    Given I have a project
    When I run the :new_app client command with:
      | app_repo | ruby:latest~https://github.com/openshift/ruby-hello-world |
      | env      | DB_USER=test                                              |
    Then the step should succeed
    And the "ruby-hello-world-1" build was created
    Given the "ruby-hello-world-1" build completed
    Given a pod becomes ready with labels:
      |deployment=ruby-hello-world-1|
    When I run the :set_env client command with:
      | resource | pods |
      | list     | true |
      | all      | true |
    And the output should contain "DB_USER=test"
    And I delete all resources from the project
    When I run the :new_app client command with:

    Given a "test" file is created with the following lines:
