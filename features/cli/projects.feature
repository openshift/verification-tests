  Scenario: Could delete all resources when delete the project
    Given a 5 characters random string of type :dns is stored into the :prj_name clipboard
    When I run the :new_project client command with:
      | project_name | <%= cb.prj_name %> |

      | mysql-56-centos7 |
      | ruby-hello-world |
    ### delete this project,make sure project is deleted
    Given the "<%= cb.prj_name %>" project is deleted
    ### get project resource after project is deleted
    When I run the :get client command with:
      | resource | dc,deployment       |
      | n        | <%= cb.prj_name %>  |

      | n        | <%= cb.prj_name %> |
    Then the step should fail
    And the output should not contain:
      | mysql-56-centos7 |

    ### create a project with same name, no context for this new one
    And I wait for the steps to pass:
    """
    Given I run the :new_project client command with:
      | project_name | <%= cb.prj_name %> |
    And the step should succeed
    """
    Then I run the :status client command
    And the output should contain:
      | no services, deployment |

  Scenario: User can get node selector from a project
    Given  an 8 character random string of type :dns is stored into the :oadmproj1 clipboard
    Given  an 8 character random string of type :dns is stored into the :oadmproj2 clipboard
    When admin creates a project with:
      | project_name | <%= cb.oadmproj1 %> |
      | admin | <%= user.name %> |
    Then the step should succeed
    When admin creates a project with:
      | project_name | <%= cb.oadmproj2 %> |
      | node_selector | env=qa |
      | description | testnodeselector |
      | admin | <%= user.name %> |
    Then the step should succeed
    When I run the :describe client command with:
      | resource | project |
      | name | <%= cb.oadmproj1 %> |
    Then the step should succeed
    And the output should match "Node Selector:\s+<none>"
    When I run the :describe client command with:
      | resource | project |
      | name | <%= cb.oadmproj2 %> |
    Then the step should succeed
    And the output should match "Node Selector:\s+env=qa"

  Scenario: Could remove user and group from the current project
    Given I have a project
    When I run the :oadm_policy_add_role_to_user client command with:
      | role_name        | admin                              |

  Scenario: Process with default FSGroup id can be ran when using the default MustRunAs as the RunAsGroupStrategy
    Given I have a project
    Given I obtain test data file "pods/hello-pod.json"
    When I run the :create client command with:
      | f | hello-pod.json |
    Then the step should succeed
    And a pod becomes ready with labels:
      | name=hello-openshift |
    Then the expression should be true> project.uid_range(user:user).begin == pod.fs_group(user:user)
