  Scenario: Gracefully delete a pod with '--grace-period' option
    Given I have a project
    Given I obtain test data file "pods/graceful-delete/10.json"
    When I run the :create client command with:
      | f | 10.json |
    Given the pod named "grace10" becomes ready
    When I run the :get client command with:
      | resource | pods |
      | resource_name | grace10 |
      | o | yaml |
    Then the output should contain "terminationGracePeriodSeconds"
    When I run the :delete background client command with:
      | object_type | pod |
      | l | name=graceful |
      | grace_period | 20 |
    Then the step should succeed
    Given 10 seconds have passed
    When I get project pods
    Then the step should succeed
    And the output should contain "Terminating"
    #The full 20 seconds have passed after this step
    Given 25 seconds have passed
    When I get project pods
    Then the step should succeed
    And the output should not contain "Terminating"
    And the output should not contain "Running"
    Given I obtain test data file "pods/graceful-delete/10.json"
    When I run the :create client command with:
      | f | 10.json |
    Given the pod named "grace10" becomes ready
    When I run the :get client command with:
      | resource | pods |
      | resource_name | grace10 |
      | o | yaml |
    Then the output should contain "terminationGracePeriodSeconds"
    When I run the :delete client command with:
      | object_type | pod |
      | l | name=graceful |
      | grace_period | 0 |
    Then the step should succeed
    When I get project pods
    Then the step should succeed
    And the output should not contain "Terminating"
    And the output should not contain "Running"

  Scenario: The namespace will not be deleted until all pods gracefully terminate
    Given I have a project
    And evaluation of `project.name` is stored in the :prj1 clipboard
    Given I obtain test data file "pods/graceful-delete/40.json"
    When I run the :create client command with:
      | f | 40.json |
    And a pod becomes ready with labels:
      | name=graceful |
    And evaluation of `pod.name` is stored in the :pod clipboard
    Given the project is deleted
    Given 10 seconds have passed
    When I run the :get admin command with:
      | resource | namespaces |
    #The namespace should not be immediately deleted,
    #because all pods in it have a graceful termination period.
    #If the namespace does not exist, it is due to bug 1277101
    #as noted in the @bug_id above.
    Then the output should match "<%= cb.prj1 %>\s+Terminating"

    And the output should match "<%= cb.pod %>.*Terminating"
    Given I wait for the steps to pass:
