  Scenario: Could get projects for new role which has permission to get projects
    Given an 8 characters random string of type :dns is stored into the :random clipboard
    And admin ensures "clusterrole-12430-<%= cb.random %>" cluster_role is deleted after scenario
    Given I obtain test data file "authorization/policy/clustergetproject.json"
