  Scenario: kubectl describe pod should show qos tier info when pod without limits and request info
    Given I have a project
    Given I obtain test data file "pods/hello-pod.json"
    When I run the :create client command with:
      | f | hello-pod.json |
    Then the step should succeed
    Given the pod named "hello-openshift" becomes ready
    When I run the :describe client command with:
      | resource | pods            |
      | name     | hello-openshift |
    Then the output should match:
      | Status:\\s+Running    |
      | BestEffort            |
