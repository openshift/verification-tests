  Scenario: CLI - Idle all the service in the same project
    Given I have a project
    Given I obtain test data file "rc/idle-rc-1.yaml"
    When I run the :create client command with:
      | f | idle-rc-1.yaml |
    Then the step should succeed
    Given I obtain test data file "rc/idle-rc-2.yaml"
    When I run the :create client command with:
      | f | idle-rc-2.yaml |
    Then the step should succeed
    Given I wait until replicationController "hello-pod" is ready
    And I wait until number of replicas match "2" for replicationController "hello-pod"
    Given 2 pods become ready with labels:
      | name=hello-pod  |
    Given I wait until replicationController "hello-idle" is ready
    And I wait until number of replicas match "2" for replicationController "hello-idle"
    Given 2 pods become ready with labels:
      | name=hello-idle |
    When I run the :idle client command with:
      | all | true      |
    Then the step should succeed
    And the output should match:
      | ReplicationController.*hello-idle |
      | ReplicationController.*hello-pod  |
    And the output should match 4 times:
      | (?i)idled |
    And I wait until number of replicas match "0" for replicationController "hello-pod"
    And I wait until number of replicas match "0" for replicationController "hello-idle"
    When I run the :get client command with:
      | resource | endpoints |
    Then the step should succeed
    And the output should match:
      | hello-idle.*none |
      | hello-svc.*none  |
    When I get project rc named "hello-pod" as YAML
    Then the output should match:
      | idling.*openshift.io/idled-at  |
    When I get project rc named "hello-idle" as YAML
    Then the output should match:
      | idling.*openshift.io/idled-at  |

  Scenario: CLI - Idle service by label

    And I wait until number of replicas match "2" for replicationController "hello-pod"
    Given 2 pods become ready with labels:
      | name=hello-pod |
    When I run the :label client command with:
      | resource | svc/hello-svc |
      | key_val  | idle=true     |
    Then the step should succeed
    When I run the :idle client command with:
      | l | idle=false |
    Then the step should succeed
    And I wait until number of replicas match "2" for replicationController "hello-pod"

    Given a "idle2.txt" file is created with the following lines:
    """
