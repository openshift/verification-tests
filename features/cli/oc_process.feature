  Scenario: Supply oc new-app parameter list+env vars via a file
    Given I have a project
    Given a "test1.env" file is created with the following lines:
    """
    MYSQL_DATABASE='test'
    """
    Given a "test2.env" file is created with the following lines:
    """
    APPLE=CLEMENTINE
    """
    Given a "test3.env" file is created with the following lines:
    """
    APPLE=BANANA
    """
    Given a "test4.env" file is created with the following lines:
    """
    MYSQL_DATABASE='abc'
    """
    #1
    Given I obtain test data file "build/application-template-stibuild.json"
    When I run the :new_app client command with:
      | app_repo   | application-template-stibuild.json |
      | param_file | test1.env              |
    Then the step should succeed
    Given the "ruby-sample-build-1" build was created
    And the "ruby-sample-build-1" build completes
    Given a pod becomes ready with labels:
      | deployment=frontend-1 |

      | resource | pods/<%= pod.name %> |
      | list     | true                 |
    And the output should contain:

    And I run the :delete client command with:
      | object_type | all |
