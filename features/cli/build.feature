  Scenario: Create a build config based on the provided image and source code
    Given I have a project
    When I run the :new_build client command with:
      | code         | https://github.com/openshift/ruby-hello-world |
      | image_stream | openshift/ruby                                |

    Then the step should succeed
    When I run the :describe client command with:
      | resource | bc               |
      | name     | ruby-hello-world |
    Then the output should match:
      | URL:\\s+https://github.com/openshift/ruby-hello-world|
    Given the pod named "ruby-hello-world-1-build" becomes ready
    When I get project builds
    Then the output should contain:
      | NAME                |
      | ruby-hello-world-1  |
    When I get project is
    Then the output should contain:
      | ruby-hello-world |
    When I run the :new_build client command with:
      | app_repo | centos/ruby-22-centos7~https://github.com/openshift/ruby-hello-world.git |
      | strategy | docker |
      | name     | n1     |
    Then the step should succeed
    When I run the :describe client command with:
      | resource | bc               |
      | name     | ruby-hello-world |
    Then the output should match:
      | URL:\\s+https://github.com/openshift/ruby-hello-world|
    Given the pod named "n1-1-build" becomes ready
    When I get project builds
    Then the output should contain:
      | NAME                |

  Scenario Outline: when delete the bc,the builds pending or running should be deleted
    Given I have a project
    Given I obtain test data file "build/<number>/test-buildconfig.json"
    When I run the :create client command with:
      | f | test-buildconfig.json |
    Then the step should succeed
    Given the "ruby-sample-build-1" build becomes <build_status>
    Then I run the :delete client command with:
      | object_type | buildConfig |
      | object_name_or_id | ruby-sample-build |
    Then the step should succeed
    And I get project buildConfig
    Then the output should not contain:
      | ruby-sample-build |
    And I get project build
    Then the output should not contain:
      | ruby-sample-build |
