  Scenario: Restart a failed deployment by oc deploy
    Given I have a project
    Given I obtain test data file "deployment/dc-with-pre-mid-post.yaml"
    When I run the :create client command with:
      | f | dc-with-pre-mid-post.yaml |
    Then the step should succeed
    # Wait and make the cancel succeed stably
    And I wait until the status of deployment "hooks" becomes :running
    When  I run the :rollout_cancel client command with:
      | resource | deploymentConfig   |
      | name     | hooks              |
    Then the step should succeed
    And I wait until the status of deployment "hooks" becomes :failed
    When I run the :rollout_status client command with:
      | resource | deploymentConfig |
      | name     | hooks            |
    Then the output should match "was cancelled"

    Then the step should succeed
    When I run the :expose client command with:

      | name          | ab-example       |
      | selector      | ab-example=true  |
    Then the step should succeed
    When I expose the "ab-example" service
    Then I wait for a web server to become available via the "ab-example" route
    And the output should contain "shardA"
    When I run the :new_app client command with:

      | name     | ab-example-a     |
      | replicas | 0                |
    Then the step should succeed
    Given I wait until number of replicas match "0" for replicationController "ab-example-a-1"
    When I use the "ab-example" service
    Then I wait for a web server to become available via the "ab-example" route
    And the output should contain "shardB"
    Then I run the :scale client command with:
      | resource | deploymentconfig |
      | name     | ab-example-b     |
      | replicas | 0                |
    Then the step should succeed
    Then I run the :scale client command with:
      | resource | deploymentconfig |
      | name     | ab-example-a     |
      | replicas | 1                |
    Then the step should succeed
    Given I wait until number of replicas match "0" for replicationController "ab-example-b-1"
    Given I wait until number of replicas match "1" for replicationController "ab-example-a-1"
    When I use the "ab-example" service
