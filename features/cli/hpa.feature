  Scenario: HPA shouldn't scale up target if the replicas of dc is 0
    Given I have a project
    Given I obtain test data file "hpa/dc-hello-openshift.yaml"
    When I run the :create client command with:
      | f | dc-hello-openshift.yaml |
    Then the step should succeed
    Given a pod becomes ready with labels:
      | deployment=hello-openshift-1 |
    When I run the :autoscale client command with:
      | name | dc/hello-openshift    |
      | min  | 2                     |
      | max  | 10                    |
    Then the step should succeed
    When I get project hpa
    Then the output should match:
      | hello-openshift.*80%.*2\\s+10 |
    And I wait until number of replicas match "2" for replicationController "hello-openshift-1"
    Given 2 pods become ready with labels:
      | deployment=hello-openshift-1 |
    When I run the :scale client command with:
      | resource | deploymentconfig  |
      | name     | hello-openshift   |
      | replicas | 0                 |
    Then the step should succeed
    And I wait until number of replicas match "0" for replicationController "hello-openshift-1"
    Given 35 seconds have passed
    And I wait until number of replicas match "0" for replicationController "hello-openshift-1"
    Given all existing pods die with labels:
      | deployment=hello-openshift-1 |
    When I get project pods
    Then the step should succeed
    And the output should not match:
      | hello-openshift-1.*Running |

  Scenario: HPA shouldn't scale up target if the replicas of rc is 0
    Given I have a project
    Given I obtain test data file "hpa/rc-hello-openshift.yaml"
    When I run the :create client command with:
      | f | rc-hello-openshift.yaml |
    Then the step should succeed
    Given I wait until replicationController "hello-openshift" is ready
    When I run the :autoscale client command with:
      | name | rc/hello-openshift |
      | min  | 2                  |
      | max  | 10                 |

    Then the output should match:
      | hello-openshift.*80%.*2\\s+10     |
    And I wait until number of replicas match "2" for replicationController "hello-openshift"
    Given 2 pods become ready with labels:
      | run=hello-openshift               |
    When I run the :scale client command with:
      | resource | replicationcontrollers |
      | name     | hello-openshift        |
      | replicas | 0                      |
    Then the step should succeed
    And I wait until number of replicas match "0" for replicationController "hello-openshift"
    Given 35 seconds have passed
    And I wait until number of replicas match "0" for replicationController "hello-openshift"
    Given all existing pods die with labels:
      | run=hello-openshift |
    When I get project pods
    Then the step should succeed
    And the output should not contain "hello-openshift-"
