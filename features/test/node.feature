  Scenario: nodes test
    Given I have a project
    Given I store the schedulable nodes in the clipboard
    And evaluation of `node.labels` is stored in the :labels_before clipboard
    When label "testme=go" is added to the "<%= cb.nodes.sample.name %>" node
    When label "testme=go" is added to the "<%= cb.nodes.sample.name %>" node
    Then I do nothing
    And evaluation of `node.labels` is stored in the :labels_after clipboard
    Then the expression should be true> !cb.labels_before.keys.include? 'testme'
    Then the expression should be true> cb.labels_after['testme'] == 'go'
    Then the expression should be true> project.labels.nil?
