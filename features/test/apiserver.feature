  Scenario: Quick test for baremetal cluster init
    # Currently we don't support baremetal iaas, but the iaas type will be checked by some cases with baremetal cluster
    # The platform type from the baremetal openshift we get is None, we need to handle this type and return one value(even if it's nil), 
    # ensure check iaas type with baremetal without exception and exit.
    Given evaluation of `env.iaas[:type] == "aws" ? "1500" : "1300"` is stored in the :wait_time clipboard
