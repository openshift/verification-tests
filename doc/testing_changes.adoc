= Testing code changes

== testing step changes

`grep`/`ack` for scenarios using the step and run a couple of them to make sure they still work

there are scenarios in `features/test` covering some of the features, look for related scenarios there and consider adding more tests for your feature

== testing changes to classes and rules

grep to find where these classes are used and make sure old use cases still work as before (or fix **all** old use cases)

== testing broader changes

Often changes are not well isolated and we need a good selection of tests to catch anything unexpected. Let's try to list some good selection of those:

* features/cli/create.feature:Create an application with overriding app name
** test cli, rest, pod, service, project, route, html
* features/cli/policy.feature:Add/Remove a global role
** test admin and clean-up steps (check clean-up is run in after hook via log)

Let's tag these scenarios `@smoke` so we can run all by `cucumber --tags @smoke`
