= Understanding The Tags

We use tags to catetorize different types of test scenarios. With a combination of tags, we are able to execute on a specific ci profile.

== List of Tags

[cols=2]
|===
|Tag Name
|Usage Scenario

|`@admin`
|Test scenarios that perform operations requiring the `cluster-admin` priviledge

|`@destructive`
|Test scenarios that perform operations which would result in failures of other parallel tests or create an outage/downtime to the cluster. Scenarios including: node draining, node restart, scaling down, etc.

|`@inactive`
|Inactive test scenario that is either outdated or no longer applicable. Skip tests with an `@inactive` tag

|`@flaky`
|Unreliable test that keeps failing and is recognized as test automation bug. Skip tests with a `@flaky` tag

|`@prow_unstable`
|Unstable test in Prow but can still run in QECI thus not having a `@flaky` tag. Skip tests with a `@prow_unstable` tag in Prow

|`@disconnected`
|Test that must run on a diconnected cluster

|`@proxy`
|Test that must run under a cluster/proxy configuration

|`@serial`
|Test that can not run in parallel, scenarios including: console test, `oc debug node`, etc

|`@aws-ipi`
|Test scenarios for aws ipi

== Running Tests With Tags

Use `cucumber --tags "@foo"` to execute all test scenarios with tag `@foo`

Use `cucumber --tags "not @foo"` to execute all test scenarios without tag `@foo`

Use `cucumber --tags "@foo and @bar"` to execute all test scenarios with both tag `@foo` and `@bar`

Use `cucumber --tags "@foo and not @bar"` to execute all test scenarios with tag `@foo` and without tag `@bar`
